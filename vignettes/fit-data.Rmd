Fitting a size spectrum to a data set using likelihood is done using the
function `fit_size_spectrum()`. The function automatically selects the
method to use based on the class of the data, as described by Table 2 in [2].

### MLE method

This simplest method is given a vector of measurements, such as body masses or
body lengths, fit the size spectrum to calculate the maximum likelihood estimate
(the MLE method) of the size-spectrum exponent, and also provide confidence
intervals.

The simulated data used for Figures 1 and 2 of
[1](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.12641/full)
are included as the data object `sim_vec` (which stands for simulated vector) in
sizeSpectra2, and so we can just use that.

```{r MLE1}
sim_vec[1:10]
res_vec <- fit_size_spectrum(sim_vec)
res_vec    # full list, so do something simpler

```

`r knitr::knit_exit()`

This vignette reproduces the main results in the manuscript, and can easily be
used as a template for users to apply to their own data or model outputs. The longer
`results-extra` vignette gives more details of outputs and further examples of
plotting features.

Set up:
```{r setup}
library(hdiAnalysis)
library(dplyr)
```

## Analyse a single vector of values

Our first 'data' set is the hake Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) recruitment
values for 2021, which is saved as a data object in the package as
`rec_2021`. It is a simple vector of the 8,000 MCMC values, and we will use it
to create Figure 1 and associated numbers. To run this code on your own
data you just need to have your values in a vector, and replace `rec_2021` with the
name of your vector.

```{r vector}
vec <- rec_2021
summary(vec)
length(vec)
```

We use the `create_intervals` function to do the main calculations. We call the
results here `res_vec` for results on a vector, so that the subsequent code will not need changing by users for their own analyses:

```{r vectorres}
res_vec <- create_intervals(vec)
res_vec
```
As seen above, `res_vec` is a list, with first element `$intervals` containing
results such as the median, lower and upper bounds for the equal-tailed interval
(ETI) and for the highest density interval (HDI) , widths of the
ETI and HDI, and more. See `?create_intervals` for full details of what is returned.
We will show a summary table of the key values after plotting the
figures.

The second element of `res_vec` is `$density` (seen above), which is a
kernel density estimate of the distribution represented by the samples in
`vec`. It is useful for plotting and calculating approximate intervals.

The HDI is calculated by `create_intervals()` using the `HDInterval::hdi()`
function, and we explore other choices in the `results-extra` vignette.

## Plot the distribution showing the ETI and HDI -- Figure 1

Plotting the resulting density function and intervals is simply done using our
custom plotting functions, with options for automatically adding intervals and
lines. The ETI plot (Figure 1A) is:
```{r plot, fig.height = 4}
plot(res_vec,
     type = "eti",
     xlim = c(0, 40),
     ylim = c(0, 0.11),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Recruitment (billions of age-0 fish)",
     arrowhead_gap = 0.1)
```
and the HDI plot (Figure 1B) is
```{r plot2, fig.height = 4}
plot(res_vec,
     type = "hdi",
     xlim = c(0, 40),
     ylim = c(0, 0.11),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Recruitment (billions of age-0 fish)",
     arrowhead_gap = 0.1)
```
The `plot()` command automatically uses our custom plotting function
`plot.intervals_density()`, because the `res_vec` object has our class
`intervals_density`. See `?plot.intervals_density()` for details and full
options. Our complete Figure 1
is reproduced with the command `figure_1()`, which can be adapted by users if
desired for their own data, or just adapt the above code as necessary
(e.g., change the limits and labels).

The main values of interest are simplified in our customised `summary_table()` function:
```{r tab, results = "asis"}
summary_table(res_vec)
```

The full results are
```{r fullres}
res_vec$intervals %>% a()       # a() is our shorthand function for as.data.frame()
```
for which definitions are given in the help file `?create_intervals`.


## MCMC samples for multiple years -- recruitment for Figure 2A

We now present calculations for multiple data sets, in our case multiple years
of MCMC samples of hake recruitment.

The values are saved in the package as the tibble `hake_recruitment_mcmc`, with each
column corresponding to a year
(with the first column representing the Virgin unfished equilibrium biomass) and
each of the 8,000 rows representing an MCMC sample:
```{r hake_mcmc}
hake_recruitment_mcmc
```

For your own data, wrangle it into the same kind of tibble, with rows
representing the MCMC samples.

To create ETIs and HDIs for estimates of recruitment for each year, we can simply use
`create_intervals()` which, because `hake_recruitment_mcmc` has class
`data.frame`, uses our function `create_intervals.data.frame()` to automatically
calculate intervals for each column (year in this case, and we will exclude the
Virgin column) of samples.
```{r hake_mcmc2}
res_all_years <- create_intervals(dplyr::select(hake_recruitment_mcmc,
                                                -"Virgin"))
```
This gives a list object, with element `res_all[[i]]` corresponding to column `i`
of the data. Each `res_all[[i]]` element is itself a list, giving the same
results as above for a single vector (and also with the `$name`
element corresponding the column of the input, a year in this example). So the
2021 results from above are:
```{r hake_mcmc3}
res_all_years$res_all[[56]]
```

For convenience, the intervals for all years are saved in a single tibble:
```{r hake_mcmc4}
res_all_years$intervals_all
```
The first column is called `quantity` for generalisability so the code can be
applied to different types of data; in this example it represents the years

To see the main values of interest, namely the ETIs and HDIs and the difference
between their widths:
```{r hake_mcmc5}
summary_table(res_all_years)
```

The sum of the differences over all years between the width of the ETI and width
of the HDI, (but excluding 2023 and 2024 as these are not informed by data for
our hake recruitment values), is
```{r hake_mcmc6}
res_all_years$intervals_all %>%
  dplyr::filter(!quantity %in% c(2023, 2024)) %>%
  dplyr::pull(width_diff) %>%
  sum()
```
which is the source of the ``>30 billion fish`` statement reported in the main text.

To plot the time series shown in Fig. 2A, we have a custom plotting function
`plot.intervals_density_list()`, that gets called because `res_all_years` is
defined to have class `intervals_density_list`, so we can just use:
```{r hake_mcmc7}
plot(res_all_years,
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Recruitment (billions of fish)")
```

<!-- The ETIs match those shown in Table 24 of the 2024 hake assessment (values
manually checked, code is below but not run or printed in vignette): -->
```{r hake_mcmc8, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
res_all_years$intervals_all %>%
  dplyr::select(eti_lower, eti_upper) %>%
  a() %>%
  round(3) * 1000
```

## MCMC samples for multiple years -- relative spawning biomass for Figure 2B

We now use the same approach for the relative spawning biomass calculations
shown in Figure 2B.

The female spawning biomass is the estimated total biomass of all females in the
population that are mature (for context, roughly half of age-2 females are considered
mature). The relative spawning biomass is the females spawning biomass divided
by that for the unfished equilibrium state (the calculation is already done for
each MCMC sample and then the ratios saved).

The values are saved in the package
as a tibble `hake_relative_biomass_mcmc` with years as column headings, and also
includes forecasts made assuming constant catches in 2024, 2025,
and 2026 of 350,000 t, which is close to the average coastwide catch from 2014-2023.
Values correspond to the relative spawning biomass at the start of the
corresponding year (before any fishing).

We can use similar code to above (since the values are in a tibble):
```{r allyears}
res_all_years_2 <- create_intervals(hake_relative_biomass_mcmc)

res_all_years_2$intervals_all

res_all_years_2$intervals_all %>% tail()
```

<!-- To confirm that the ETIs match those in Table b of the 2024 hake assessment -->
<!-- (which does not have 2025 onwards); keeping the code for reference -->

```{r allyearsmatch, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
res_all_years_2$intervals_all %>%
  filter(quantity >= 2015) %>%
  mutate(`Year` = quantity,
         `Rel. SB 2.5th percentile` = eti_lower * 100,
         `Rel. SB median` = median * 100,
         `Rel. SB 97.5th percentile` = eti_upper * 100) %>%
  select(`Year`:`Rel. SB 97.5th percentile`) %>%
  filter(`Year` <= 2024) %>%
  knitr::kable(digits = 1)
```

To create Figure 2B, which includes the forecasts:
```{r biomassseries}
plot(res_all_years_2,
     xlim = c(2010, 2027),
     ylim = c(0, 2.6),
     add_line_at_0.4 = TRUE,
     inc = 0.05,
     leg_loc = "topleft",
     xlab = "Year",
     ylab = "Relative spawning biomass")
```

Whether the relative spawning biomass is above or below the management reference point
of 0.4 is key in forming stakeholders' perception of the health of the hake
stock. As seen in the figure, in 2024 and 2025 the ETI does not dip below 0.4 but
the HDI does. Thus, the perception of current and future stock status can depend upon the
definition of credible intervals (ETI versus HDI). The specific years across the
whole time series for which this happens are:

```{r whichyears}
dplyr::filter(res_all_years_2$intervals_all,
              eti_lower > 0.4,
              hdi_lower < 0.4)
```

Also, on the plot the years 2016 and 2020 look like they are also exhibiting this
behaviour, but in fact the HDI is very slightly above 0.4:
```{r whichyearsclose}
dplyr::filter(res_all_years_2$intervals_all,
              quantity %in% c(2016, 2020))
```

To see all the values of interest:
```{r summarytab2}
summary_table(res_all_years_2)
```

To plot results for a single year, for example 2024, extract the results
from the list and use our plotting function, and tailor the figure as necessary
by setting the arguments (see `?plot.intervals_density`):
```{r plotoneyear, fig.height = 10}
index_for_2024 <- which(res_all_years_2$intervals_all$quantity == 2024)
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
plot(res_all_years_2[["res_all"]][[index_for_2024]],
     type = "eti",
     xlim = c(0, 3.5),
     ylim = c(0, 1.2),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Relative spawning biomass in 2024",
     y_arrow = 1.07,
     arrowhead_gap = 0.01,
     x_minor_ticks_by = 0.25,
     y_minor_ticks_by = 0.05)

plot(res_all_years_2[["res_all"]][[index_for_2024]],
     type = "hdi",
     xlim = c(0, 3.5),
     ylim = c(0, 1.2),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     xlab = "Relative spawning biomass in 2024",
     y_arrow = 1.07,
     arrowhead_gap = 0.01,
     x_minor_ticks_by = 0.25,
     y_minor_ticks_by = 0.05)
```

## Absolute female spawning biomass

The above was for relative female spawning biomass. We now briefly look at
absolute female spawning biomass, in units of millions of tonnes. This is also
saved as a data object in the package (`hake_spawning_biomass_mcmc`). We focus
on the values
for 2023 and 2024 which are given prominence in a bullet in the one-page summary of the hake assessment:

"The median estimate of female spawning biomass at the start of 2024 is 1,884,950 t
(with 95% credible interval from 853,207 to 4,828,382 t). This is an upward shift
from this assessment’s estimate for the 2023 female spawning biomass of 1,335,485 t
(with 95% credible interval from 652,495 to 3,224,819 t)."

So those credible intervals are ETIs. How would HDIs compare? The results are
(in millions of tonnes):
```{r sb1}
res_all_years_spawning <-
  create_intervals(dplyr::select(hake_spawning_biomass_mcmc,
                                 `2023`,
                                 `2024`))

summary_table(res_all_years_spawning)
```
The above quote, using HDIs instead of ETIs, becomes:

"The median estimate of female spawning biomass at the start of 2024 is 1,884,950 t
(with 95% credible interval from
`r f(dplyr::filter(res_all_years_spawning$intervals_all, quantity ==
                                                       2024)$hdi_lower * 1e06)` to
`r f(dplyr::filter(res_all_years_spawning$intervals_all, quantity ==
                                                       2024)$hdi_upper * 1e06)` t).
This is an upward shift
from this assessment’s estimate for the 2023 female spawning biomass of 1,335,485 t
(with 95% credible interval from
`r f(dplyr::filter(res_all_years_spawning$intervals_all, quantity ==
                                                       2023)$hdi_lower * 1e06)` to
`r f(dplyr::filter(res_all_years_spawning$intervals_all, quantity ==
                                                       2023)$hdi_upper * 1e06)` t)."

The reduction in uncertainty for 2024 from switching from the ETI to the HDI is
`r f(dplyr::filter(res_all_years_spawning$intervals_all, quantity ==
                                                       2024)$width_diff * 1e06)` t.
This is larger than the average catch from 2014-2023 of 338,606 t, of which less
than half would be considered as spawning biomass (mature females; catch is
males plus females). Thus, the reduction in uncertainty is certainly not trivial.
Again, intervals are shifted downwards, implying the stock biomass is lower than implied
when using the original ETIs.

The ETI and HDI plots are
```{r,  sb2, fig.height = 10}
par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
plot(res_all_years_spawning$res_all[[which(res_all_years_spawning$intervals_all$quantity == 2024)]],
     xlim = c(0, 8),
     ylim = c(0, 0.6),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     y_arrow = 0.57,
     xlab = "Female spawning biomass in 2024 (millions of tonnes)",
     type = "eti")

plot(res_all_years_spawning$res_all[[which(res_all_years_spawning$intervals_all$quantity == 2024)]],
     xlim = c(0, 8),
     ylim = c(0, 0.6),
     interval_arrows = TRUE,
     y_arrow = 0.57,
     xlab = "Female spawning biomass in 2024 (millions of tonnes)",
     type = "hdi")
```
